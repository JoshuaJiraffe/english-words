my favorite show growing up was wander over yonder it was a show about a friendly character who goes on adventures throughout the cosmos with a fun and cool companion the reason i like it so much is because the show can be very wacky but it knows when to slow down to have genuinely heartfelt moments i hope one day it comes back now for science stuff the biggest flaw of this cipher is that if a hacker knows the first value of the plain text and of the cipher text they can use k to the k congruent cipher text one minus plain text one modulo letter m to find the value of k to the power of k to find the key through brute force and then decrypt the rest of the text in less time than just using brute force
